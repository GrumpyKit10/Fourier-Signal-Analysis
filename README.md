# Fourier-Signal-Analysis

This project demonstrates Fourier transform concepts using **MATLAB Live Scripts**.  
It analyzes a sinc input signal, its modulated versions, and their frequency-domain representations.

## Features
- Time-domain signals:
  - `x(t)` = sinc(t)
  - `y(t)` = modulated sinc with cosine
  - `yd(t)` = double-modulated signal
- Frequency-domain analysis:
  - Fourier transforms of `x(t)`, `y(t)`, `yd(t)`
  - Low-pass filtering effect demonstration
  - Visualization of magnitude spectra
- MATLAB plots:
  - Signal waveforms in time
  - Magnitude spectra in frequency

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or newer  
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for `rectangularPulse`)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fourier-Signal-Analysis.git
